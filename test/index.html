                        has been people. A human being changes continuously throughout life.
                        His thoughts and thoughts and moods change, his expressions and even his features
                        change.
                        And here we come to the crucial problem of portraiture. If the likeness of a human

                        For me, the answer has always been, the image which reveals most completely both the
                        exterior and the
                        interior of the subject.

                        unlike most of my colleagues I could not repair a motor or a watch. More and more and my
                        thoughts turned to photography.
                        I felt the urge to take pictures, to experiment, to create.
